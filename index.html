<h1 align="center">DOUBLE HOMICIDE</h1>
<p>The Noida double murder case refers to the unsolved murders of 13-year-old girl Aarushi Talwar and 45-year-old Hemraj Banjade, a male live-in domestic
 worker employed by her family. The two were killed on the night of 15–16 May 2008 at Aarushi's home in Noida, India. The case aroused public interest as 
a whodunit story, and received heavy media coverage. The sensational media coverage, which included salacious allegations against Aarushi and the suspects,
 was criticized by many as a trial by the media.</p>
<p>When Aarushi's body was discovered on 16 May, the missing servant Hemraj was considered as the main suspect. The next day, his partially decomposed body 
was discovered on the terrace. The police were heavily criticized for failing to secure the crime scene immediately. After ruling out the family's ex-servants,
 the police considered Aarushi's parents—Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar—as the prime suspects.</p>
<p>The police suspected that Rajesh had murdered the two after finding them in an "objectionable" position, or because Rajesh's alleged extra-marital affair
 had led to his blackmail by Hemraj and a confrontation with Aarushi. The accusations enraged the Talwars' family and friends, who accused the police of 
framing the Talwars in order to cover up the botched-up investigation.</p>
<p>The case was then transferred to the CBI, which exonerated the parents and suspected the Talwars' assistant Krishna Thadarai and two domestic servants
—Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal. Based on the 'narco' interrogation conducted on the three men, the CBI assumed that they had killed Aarushi after an attempted 
sexual assault, and Hemraj for being a witness. The CBI was accused of using dubious methods to extract a confession, and all the three men were released 
after it could not find any solid evidence against them.</p>
<p>In 2009, the CBI handed over the investigation to a new team, which recommended closing the case due to critical gaps in the evidence. Based on 
circumstantial evidence, it named Rajesh Talwar as the sole suspect, but refused to charge him due to lack of any hard evidence. The parents opposed the 
closure report, calling CBI's suspicion on Rajesh as baseless.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a special CBI court rejected the CBI's claim that there was not enough evidence, and ordered proceedings against the Talwars. In November 
2013, the parents were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, but many critics argued that the judgment was based on weak evidence. The Talwars 
challenged the decision in the Allahabad High Court.</p>
<p>On 12 October 2017, the court acquitted them, calling the evidence against them unsatisfactory and severely criticising the police, CBI and the media for
 not having investigated the murder properly. On 8 March 2018 the CBI challenged the acquittal in Supreme Court. The case remains unsolved.</p>
